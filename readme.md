## Overview

Custom themes and color schemes for Sublime Text.

This uses the new `.sublime-color-scheme` format and requires **at least version 3149** of Sublime.

## Installation

Clone or download the repo into Sublime's Packages folder. On MacOS, this is usually `"/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages"`. Find it in menu → Preferences → Browse Packages.

To activate the color scheme: `Command Palette → UI: Select Color Scheme → Cloud / Nether`. If you don't see a scheme, this probably means you have a **lower than 3149** version of Sublime and need to update.

Make the entire editor match the color scheme by using the built-in Adaptive theme: `Command Palette → UI: Select Theme → Adaptive`.
